JSON SCHEMA 

Created to for the blog [JSON Schema - as a specification, contract and validation!](https://pritibiyani.github.io/blog/using-json-schema-as-specification-contract-and-validate-your-api). This demonstrates how schema can be used to validate your JSON document. 

How to run 
- clone the project 
- run `./gradlew test`

The test file has two sample example of correct and incorrect json document. Play around with those and check what error json validator gives.
